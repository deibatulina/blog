## Last week's post

### Monday

  The week began with studying at a remote location. I listened to the lecture, then went to visit friends, did my homework. It turned out productively!
  
  
### Tuesday

  The couples were interesting today. At the matanalysis, candy was distributed for the correct answers.
  
  
### Wednesday

  Today are my favorite subjects! The day is beautiful.
  
  
### Thursday

  Today we tried to fix an incorrectly working function in C++, and we did it. Hurray! In the evening we went to the cinema for a disaster movie.
  
  
### Friday

  I went to English classes, passed the papers. And in the evening we went for a walk around the city center and went to have dinner in a cafe. The perfect end to the day.
