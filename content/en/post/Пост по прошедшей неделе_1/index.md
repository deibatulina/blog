## Last week's post

### Monday

  My week began with a school Monday at a remote location. I had two pairs in a row: mathematical logic and programming technology. Then I sat down for homework, of which, unfortunately, we have quite a lot. After finishing my homework, I went to the supermarket for groceries, and then I cooked food: my favorite cutlets with potatoes and a vegetable salad. In the evening, I was preparing for the next school day and went to bed relatively early, at 23:00, so that the next morning I could go to the first couple at my favorite university.
  
### Tuesday

  In the morning I woke up and realized that I had overslept and, of course, I did not go to university. I stayed at home, doing my homework again to free up the weekend for myself. And then I remembered that I was officially on sick leave and this day would not be considered truancy.
  
  
### Wednesday

  March 8th! My friend and I went for a walk around the city, we were presented with a wonderful bouquet of tulips, we ate rolls and in the evening I went to the theater to see the play “Onegin”. The performance was truly gorgeous! I returned home late, immediately deciding that I would not go to the first couple on Thursday.
  
  
### Thursday

  A miracle happened, and I went to the first couple! This day turned out to be great: the boys congratulated us on the last holiday, presented cupcakes and postcards.
  
  
### Friday

  In the morning I did my homework, and in the afternoon I went to the university for a speech on the Translator Module. We danced, and instead of couples we were allowed to go home. In the evening I was preparing a history report. Beautiful day!
