## Last week's post

### Monday

  We had one remote couple, at which I gave a report. I hope he gets a high rating! And now I'm doing homework in all other subjects.
  
### Tuesday

  I need to go to the university (to write a test on matanalysis), then to the hospital and then to training.
  
  
### Wednesday

  On Wednesday I was writing a test paper on analytical geometry. I hope I wrote it well. 
  
### Thursday

  In the morning, I moved to the university to take the last laboratory on programming technology, as well as listen to two lectures on matanalysis.
  
  
### Friday

  Fridays are always hard for me, because we have four pairs in a row, and the last one ends at 19:20. I had to hand in an essay and my only debt.
  
### P.S.

  Thank you for reading! Follow me so as not to miss the exits of new posts!
