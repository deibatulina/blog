## Making reports
### Getting started

At the very beginning, we had to clone the repository from the github, which the teacher gave us, in order to be able to generate reports on laboratory work using ready-made templates that just need to be filled in with our data.

### What kind of reports?

All laboratory work must be carried out with the fixation of screen shots (screenshots) that record the completion of laboratory work tasks. 

### Components of the report 

The report should include:

1. The title page with the number of the laboratory work and the full name of the student.
2. Formulation of the purpose of the work.
3. Description of the results of the task:
– screenshots (screenshots) that record the performance of laboratory work;
– listings (source code) of programs (if any);
– program execution results (text or screenshot depending on
the task).
4. Conclusions agreed with the purpose of the work.
5. Answers to security questions.

### Report format

The report is written in Markdown, then using the make command it is generated in docx and pdf formats thanks to the use of makefile.
