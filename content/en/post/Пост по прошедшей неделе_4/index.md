## Last week's post

### Monday

  We had a day off on Monday. So I went for a walk with friends in the morning, then did my homework, and in the evening my friend and I went to the theater.
  
### Tuesday

  In the morning I went to the university. The first pair we had was matanalysis, and the second was computer algebra. Then I went to training: there I ran a lot, did strength exercises, in general, spent time with benefits for my health. I enjoyed the day!


### Wednesday

  And on Wednesday we also had only 2 pairs in the morning - analytical geometry and mathematical logic. I adore these items, so time flies unnoticed for me on these pairs.
  
  
### Thursday

  In the morning I came to the second pair - programming technology. It turned out to be interesting, we went through matrices and wrote some operators for them. Then we had a break, and after that - a couple of lectures on matanalysis.
  
  
### Friday

  Today I decided to give myself the opportunity to relax, and I did not go to pairs on the translator module. I went to visit my uncle and did some homework.
